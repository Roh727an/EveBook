# Evebook 🎟️

Evebook is a **web-based event booking platform** developed as part of a 3rd-year project by a team of five members. The primary goal of Evebook is to help users easily discover, organize, and book events in a seamless manner. With a focus on delivering an interactive and user-friendly experience, Evebook caters to both event organizers and attendees, providing a range of features to simplify the event management process.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Event Listings**: Explore a variety of events categorized by type (e.g., concerts, workshops, sports events). Each event comes with detailed descriptions, dates, locations, and pricing information.
- **Booking and Ticketing**: Book tickets directly through the platform with a smooth and straightforward checkout process.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for personalized user accounts, allowing you to manage your bookings with ease.
- **Event Management for Organizers**: Event organizers can create and manage events, set ticket prices, manage availability, and add detailed event descriptions.
- **Additional Features**: Based on feedback from mentors, Evebook also includes features like **discounts** and **contractor details** for event support, providing additional value for event organizers.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to deliver a responsive and intuitive user interface for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Backend**: Developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which handle server-side functionality such as user authentication, event management, and ticket booking operations.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** is used for scalable data storage, handling user data, event details, and booking information efficiently.
